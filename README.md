Solidworks assignments for the robot arm project (some are from Engineering 2 and some have been modified for the project)

## Gears
### Objective
Create 4 different configurations of gears using equations to define variables

### Lessons & Methods
In this assignment, I learned that equations can be used in Solidworks, meaning that changing a value will change related values proportionally, and create a similarly shaped part.

## Gearbox
### Objective
Use the gears from the last assignment and build a box where all the gears turn together when you turn a knob.

### Lessons & Methods
In this assignment I relearned how to use revolved base and cut (in the knob part) and learned how to use gear mates in the assembly.

## Motion Study
### Objective
Build a contraption where a servo arm pushes a shelf up, and then use a motion study to see this in action

### Lessons & Methods
In this assignment I learned how to set up a motion study, by defining gravity, a motor, and selecting parts that will move when contacting each other. Additionally, I learned how to use a shell cut in creating many of the individual parts.
